"1The term victim may refer to a person, business, institution, or society as a whole.",,,,

  has been identified, which distinguishes him/her from an unknown offender.",,,,
3In a multiple-bias incident two conditions must be met:  1) more than one offense type must occur in the incident and 2) at least two offense types must be motivated by different biases.,,,,
